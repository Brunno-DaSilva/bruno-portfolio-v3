### Application Development:

Clean and intuitive design with a modern application design and a fresh color pallet exploring a bold take on dark mode. I decided to focus on the user experience providing the users free from distractions and a clean layout approach.

The dark mode was one of my goals and the UseState hook made my life super easy where I could setDarkMode based on conditional rendering.

Finally, I incorporated sanity.io in the backend. Sanity provides a super simple approach to CMS, which made it easy for me to manage my backend. Their approach to schema creation is super easy and intuitive.
